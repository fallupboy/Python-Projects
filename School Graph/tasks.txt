Reading data from .json file. 

Json is a type of data format used to store, read and write data. 
It is the most modern and convenient way to store data, it is fast, object/dictionary accessible and lightweight.

In this folder you have  .json file with data in it. Write a py app to get asked results:

(All results should be executed Programmaticaly! Imagine that data will change tomorrow and you will have +10 new students and teachers, so make sure
 your code logic will work for them too.)

1. Get the most popular student in class. 
2. Get the most popular teacher in class. 
3. How many people in school? (Tip: teachers + students)
4. Get All students who's name starts with 'M'.
5. Get Favorite student among all teachers.
6. Get the teacher, who's Last Name (!) starts with 'G'.

Good luck.
